# Added constants

Several constants have been added dynamically by the subsystem `Constants`.

The list is :
* `ROOT_DIR` : The project root path
* `APP_DIR` : The path to the directory `app/`
* `CONFIG_DIR` : The path to the directory `app/config/`
* `MODULES_DIR` : The path to the directory `app/modules/`
* `SRC_DIR` : The path to the directory `src/`
* `CLI_DIR` : The path to the directory `src/cli/`
* `WEB_DIR` : The path to the directory `web/`

Front files `cli.php` and `web/index.php` also define the constant `CLI_MODE` to know if the script is run from the console or not.
